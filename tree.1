Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory,
an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@') after each
symbolic link, an equal sign (`=') after each socket, and a vertical bar
(`|') after each that is a FIFO.
.It Fl i
Do not print nice tree indentation, if you want this, you should be using
.Xr find 1
instead.
.It Fl l
Symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl L Ar depth
Directory recursion stops at depth `depth'.
.It Fl r
Reverse sort order, whether it is alphabetical or by time modified.
